# 21cmFastHMXB
---
#### This is the modified version of the original [21cmFast code](https://github.com/andreimesinger/21cmFAST). It is a semi numerical code which can produce 3D cosmological realisations of many physical fields in the early Universe. It can efficiently generate density, velocity, halo, ionization, spin temperature, 21-cm, and even ionizing flux fields.

### Key feature: 
* The main key feature of this code is that it can take any luminosity of high mass x-ray binaries as input and produce the relevant output. The luminosity can be given via the input file xray_spectra.dat located in the external tables folder.
